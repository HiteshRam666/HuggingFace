## 🚀 Key Libraries & Features

### 1. **Transformers 🦄**
The go-to library for state-of-the-art models like **BERT**, **GPT-3**, **T5**, and more!  
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Sentiment analysis pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("Hugging Face is amazing!")
print(result)
```

### 2. **Datasets 📚**
Effortlessly access and manage datasets for your ML projects.  
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load IMDb dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
print(dataset)
```

### 3. **Tokenizers ✂️**
Fast, efficient, and highly customizable tokenization.  
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load a tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
tokens = tokenizer("Hello Hugging Face!")
print(tokens)
```

### 4. **Gradio + Spaces 🌐**
Build and share interactive ML demos using **Gradio** and host them for free on **Spaces**.  
```python
import gradio as gr

# Simple Gradio demo
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}!"

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text")
demo.launch()
```
